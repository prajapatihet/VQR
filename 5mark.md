1. **Problem:** The rate of interest for the first 3 years is 6% per annum, for the next 4 years 7% per annum, and for the period beyond 7 years is 7.5% per annum. If a man lends out Rs 2400 for 11 years, find the total interest earned by him. What is the difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest?

   **Solution:** 
   To calculate the interest earned, we need to calculate the interest for each time period separately and then sum them up.

   For the first 3 years: 
   Interest = Principal × Rate × Time = 2400 × 0.06 × 3 = Rs 432

   For the next 4 years:
   Interest = Principal × Rate × Time = 2400 × 0.07 × 4 = Rs 672

   For the remaining 4 years:
   Interest = Principal × Rate × Time = 2400 × 0.075 × 4 = Rs 720

   Total Interest = 432 + 672 + 720 = Rs 1824

   The difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest lies in the way interest is calculated. Simple Interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount, whereas Compound Interest takes into account the accumulated interest as well, leading to higher overall interest over time.

2. **Problem:** Nine persons went to a hotel for taking their meals. Eight of them spent Rs 12 each on their meal, and the ninth person spent Rs 8 more than the average expenditure of all nine. What was the total money spent by them? Why is average so important in our common life?

   **Solution:**
   Total spent by eight persons = 8 × 12 = Rs 96
   Let the average expenditure of all nine be "x".
   So, the expenditure of the ninth person = x + 8
   Total money spent = 96 + (x + 8) = 104 + x

   The concept of average is important in our common life as it helps us understand the overall trend or behavior of a set of values. It provides a representative value that gives us an idea of the central tendency, helping us make informed decisions and comparisons.

3. **Problem:** Find the compound interest on Rs 1000 at the rate of 20% per annum for 18 months when interest is compounded half-yearly. Also define Interest, Amount, Creditor, Debtor.

   **Solution:**
   Compound Interest formula: A = P × (1 + r/n)^(nt)
   Where:
   A = Total amount after interest
   P = Principal amount (initial investment)
   r = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
   t = Time in years

   Given P = Rs 1000, r = 0.20, n = 2 (compounded half-yearly), t = 1.5 years (18 months)

   A = 1000 × (1 + 0.20/2)^(2 × 1.5) ≈ Rs 1374.30
   Compound Interest = A - P = 1374.30 - 1000 = Rs 374.30

   - Interest: The fee paid for borrowing money or the income earned on an investment.
   - Amount: The total value after including both the principal and the interest.
   - Creditor: The person or entity to whom money is owed.
   - Debtor: The person or entity who owes money to someone else.

4. **Problem:** Find the compound interest on Rs 1000 at the rate of 20% per annum for 18 months when interest is compounded half-yearly. Also define Interest, Amount, Creditor, Debtor.

   (This problem appears to be a repetition of the previous one. Refer to Solution 3.)

5. **Problem:** The average weight of 5 men is decreased by 3 kg when one of them weighing 150 kg is replaced by another person. This new person is again replaced by another person whose weight is 30 kg lower than the person he replaced. What is the overall change in the average due to this dual change? Why is average so important in our common life?

   **Solution:**
   Initial average weight = (Total weight of 5 men) / 5
   Final average weight = (Total weight of 5 men after changes) / 5

   First replacement: Decrease in average weight = 3 kg
   Second replacement: Decrease in average weight = 30 kg

   Overall change in average = (Decrease + Decrease) / 5 = (3 + 30) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6 kg

   Average is important in our common life as it provides a convenient way to summarize a set of data and understand the central tendency. It helps us quickly assess the general trend without getting lost in the details of individual data points.

6. **Problem:** A sum of money was invested at Simple Interest at a certain rate for 3 years. Had it been invested at a 4% higher rate, it would have fetched Rs 480 more. Find the Principal? What is the difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest.

   **Solution:**
   Let the principal amount be "P" and the initial rate of interest be "r".

   Simple Interest formula: SI = P × r × t
   Compound Interest formula: CI = P × (1 + r/n)^(nt) - P

   Given t = 3 years, CI difference = 480, r increase = 0.04

   According to the problem, the difference in CI due to the rate increase is 480:
   CI (higher rate) - CI (original rate) = 480

   Substituting values:
   P × [(1 + r + 0.04)^(3 * 1)] - P × (1 + r)^3 = 480

   Solve for P.

   The difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest lies in the way interest is calculated. Simple Interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount, whereas Compound Interest takes into account the accumulated interest as well, leading to higher overall interest over time.

7. **Problem:** Three persons Amar, Akbar, and Anthony invested different amounts in a fixed deposit scheme for one year at the rate of 12% per annum and earned a total interest of Rs 3240. If the amount invested by Akbar is Rs 5000 more than the amount invested by Amar and the amount invested by Anthony is Rs 2000 more than the amount invested by Akbar, what is the amount invested by Akbar?

   **Solution:**
   Let's denote the amount invested by Amar as "A", by Akbar as "A + 5000", and by Anthony as "A + 5000 + 2000".

   Total interest earned = A × 0.12 + (A + 5000) × 0.12 + (A + 7000) × 0.12 = 0.36A + 12000 = 3240

   Solve for A.

8. **Problem:** The average weight of 5 men is decreased by 3 kg when one of them weighing 150 kg is replaced by

 another person. This new person is again replaced by another person whose weight is 30 kg lower than the person he replaced. What is the overall change in the average due to this dual change? Why is average so important in our common life?

   **Solution:**
