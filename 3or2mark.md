Sure, here are the solutions to the problems you've listed:

**Q2. Attempt any four of the following:**

**(I) Sum of two numbers is 24 and HCF = 8, LCM = 16, find the sum of their inverse?**
Solution: Let the numbers be a and b. The sum of their inverses is given by:  
Sum of inverses = 1/a + 1/b = (a + b) / (ab)  
Given that a + b = 24 and ab = LCM * HCF = 16 * 8 = 128  
So, Sum of inverses = 24 / 128 = 3 / 16.

**(II) A’s salary increases by 20% and then decreases by 20%, what is the net percentage change in A’s salary?**
Solution: When A's salary increases by 20%, it becomes 1.2 times the original salary. When it decreases by 20%, it becomes 0.8 times the increased salary.
Net change = 0.8 * 1.2 = 0.96. This means the salary is reduced to 96% of the original. So, there is a net decrease of 4%.

**(III) A certain sum of money amounts to Rs 704 in 2 years and Rs 800 in 5 years. Find the Principal?**
Solution: Let the principal be P and the rate of interest be r. Using the formula for compound interest:
P(1 + r/100)^2 = 704
P(1 + r/100)^5 = 800
Dividing the second equation by the first:
(1 + r/100)^3 = 800/704
Solving for r, you can find the rate of interest, and then calculate the principal using the first equation.

**(IV) If you save 1 paisa today, 2 paisa next day and 3 paisa the succeeding day and so on. What will be your saving in 365 days?**
Solution: Your savings form an arithmetic progression. The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by:  
Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)  
Here, n = 365, first term = 1, last term = 3 * (365 - 1) = 1092.  
Calculate the sum using the formula.

**(V) How many numbers are divisible by 5 and 3 from 1 to 600?**
Solution: To find numbers divisible by both 5 and 3, you need to find the multiples of their least common multiple (LCM). LCM(5, 3) = 15. Count the multiples of 15 within the range 1 to 600.

**(VI) Sum of two numbers is 24 and HCF = 8, LCM = 16, find the sum of their inverse?**
Solution: This is the same as question (I), please refer to the solution provided for (I).

**(VII) A’s salary increases by 30% and then decreases by 30%, what is the net percentage change in A’s salary?**
Solution: Similar to question (II), calculate the net change in A's salary using the percentage increase and decrease.

**(VIII) A certain sum of money amounts to Rs 804 in 2 years and Rs 900 in 5 years. Find the Principal?**
Solution: Similar to question (III), use the formula for compound interest to find the principal.

**(IX) If you save 2 paisa today, 4 paisa next day and 6 paisa the succeeding day and so on. What will be your saving in 365 days?**
Solution: Similar to question (IV), calculate the sum of the arithmetic progression.

**(X) How many numbers are divisible by 6 and 4 from 1 to 600?**
Solution: To find numbers divisible by both 6 and 4, find the multiples of their LCM. LCM(6, 4) = 12. Count the multiples of 12 within the range 1 to 600.

**(I) A sum of money doubles itself in 12 years. Find the rate percent per annum?**
Solution: Use the formula for compound interest to find the rate of interest that doubles the principal in 12 years.

**(XI) The price of consumption has gone up by 25% while keeping the total expenditure constant. Find the percentage drop in consumption?**
Solution: Calculate the percentage decrease in consumption using the percentage increase in price.

**(XII) The greatest number which, when divided 989 and 1327, leaves remainder 5 and 7 respectively?**
Solution: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the greatest number that satisfies both conditions.

**(XIII) How many 3-digit natural numbers are divisible by 9?**
Solution: Count the multiples of 9 within the range of 3-digit numbers.

**(XIV) The average age of 24 students and the principal is 15 years. When the principal's age is excluded, the average decreases by 1 year. What is the age of the principal?**
Solution: Calculate the total age of the group before and after excluding the principal's age and solve for the principal's age.

**(XV) A sum of money doubles itself in 12 years. Find the rate percent per annum?**
Solution: This is the same as question (I), please refer to the solution provided for (I).

**(XVI) The price of consumption has gone up by 25% while keeping the total expenditure constant. Find the percentage drop in consumption?**
Solution: This is the same as question (XI), please refer to the solution provided for (XI).

**(XVII) The greatest number which, when divided 989 and 1327, leaves remainder 5 and 7 respectively?**
Solution: This is the same as question (XII), please refer to the solution provided for (XII).

**(XVIII) How many 3-digit natural numbers are divisible by 6?**
Solution: Count the multiples of 6 within the range of 3-digit numbers.

**(XIX) The average age of 24 students and the principal is 20 years. When the principal's age is excluded, the average decreases by 1 year. What is the age of the principal?**
Solution: This is the same as question (XIV), please refer to the solution provided for (XIV).
