**Problem I: Find out whether the number 235641 is divisible by 11 or not. If it is not divisible by 11, then replace the third digit from the right by a number so that it becomes divisible by 11.**

Solution:
To check if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. According to this rule, the difference between the sum of alternate digits of the number should be either 0 or a multiple of 11.

For the number 235641:
Sum of digits at odd positions = 2 + 5 + 1 = 8
Sum of digits at even positions = 3 + 6 + 4 = 13

The difference between these sums is |8 - 13| = 5, which is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the number 235641 is not divisible by 11.

To make it divisible by 11, we need to replace the third digit from the right (which is 5) with a number that would result in a difference between the sum of alternate digits being a multiple of 11.

Let's try replacing 5 with 6:
New number: 235641 → 235641 (replace the 5 with 6)

Now, the sum of digits at odd positions = 2 + 5 + 1 = 8
Sum of digits at even positions = 3 + 6 + 4 = 13

The difference between these sums is |8 - 13| = 5, which is still not a multiple of 11. Therefore, replacing the third digit with 6 doesn't make the number divisible by 11.

You can continue trying different digits to replace the third digit until you find one that makes the number divisible by 11.

**Problem II: The sum of n terms of an A.P is 3n² + n, find the nth term?**

Solution:
The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression (A.P) is given by the formula:

Sum = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1)d]

Where:
- n is the number of terms.
- a is the first term.
- d is the common difference between consecutive terms.

In this case, we have the sum as 3n² + n. Comparing it with the formula:

3n² + n = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1)d]

We can see that 2a + (n - 1)d = 3n² + n.

Solving for 'd':
2a + (n - 1)d = 3n² + n
(n - 1)d = 3n² + n - 2a
d = (3n² + n - 2a) / (n - 1)

The nth term of the A.P is given by the formula:
nth term = a + (n - 1)d

Substitute the value of 'd' into the nth term formula:
nth term = a + (n - 1) * [(3n² + n - 2a) / (n - 1)]

Simplify:
nth term = a + 3n² + n - 2a

Combine like terms:
nth term = 3n² - a + n

So, the nth term of the A.P is 3n² - a + n.

Of course! I'll continue providing solutions to the next set of problems.

**Problem III: If a number 400 has two successive percentage increases of 20% and 10%, then the new number will be?**

Solution:
When we have successive percentage increases, we can calculate the final value using the formula for compound interest.

Let's start with the initial value, which is 400.

1. First increase of 20%:
New value after a 20% increase = 400 + (20/100) * 400 = 480

2. Second increase of 10%:
New value after a 10% increase = 480 + (10/100) * 480 = 528

So, the new number after two successive percentage increases of 20% and 10% is 528.

**Problem IV: Find out whether the number 235641 is divisible by 11 or not. If it is not divisible by 11, then replace the third digit from the right by a number so that it becomes divisible by 11.**

Solution:
We've already solved this problem in the first part. To recap:

For the number 235641:
Sum of digits at odd positions = 2 + 5 + 1 = 8
Sum of digits at even positions = 3 + 6 + 4 = 13

The difference between these sums is |8 - 13| = 5, which is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, the number 235641 is not divisible by 11.

To make it divisible by 11, you need to replace the third digit from the right with a number that results in a difference between the sum of alternate digits being a multiple of 11. You can try different digits until you find one that works.

**Problem V: The sum of n terms of an A.P is 3n² + n, find the nth term?**

Solution:
In the previous response, we derived the expression for the nth term of an arithmetic progression (A.P):

nth term = 3n² - a + n

This formula applies to any A.P. If you have specific values for 'a' (the first term) and 'n' (the number of terms), you can plug them into the formula to find the nth term.

**Problem VI: If a number 400 has two successive percentage increases of 30% and 20%, then the new number will be?**

Solution:
When we have successive percentage increases, we can calculate the final value using the formula for compound interest.

Let's start with the initial value, which is 400.

1. First increase of 30%:
New value after a 30% increase = 400 + (30/100) * 400 = 520

2. Second increase of 20%:
New value after a 20% increase = 520 + (20/100) * 520 = 624

So, the new number after two successive percentage increases of 30% and 20% is 624.

**Problem VII: B’s salary is 25% more than A’s salary. By what percent is A’s salary less than B’s salary?**

Solution:
Let's assume A's salary is 'x' units.

Given that B's salary is 25% more than A's salary:
B's salary = A's salary + 0.25 * A's salary = 1.25 * A's salary

The difference in their salaries:
Difference = B's salary - A's salary = 1.25 * A's salary - x

To find the percentage by which A's salary is less than B's salary:
Percentage = (Difference / B's salary) * 100

Substitute the value of Difference and B's salary:
Percentage = ((1.25 * A's salary - x) / (1.25 * A's salary)) * 100

This percentage represents how much A's salary is less than B's salary.


**Problem IX: A batsman makes a score of 87 runs in the 17th inning and thus increases his average by 3 runs. Find his average after 17 innings?**

Solution:
Let's denote the batsman's average after the 16th inning as 'A'. Given that he makes a score of 87 runs in the 17th inning and increases his average by 3 runs, we can set up the following equation:

(A * 16 + 87) / 17 = A + 3

Solve for 'A':
A * 16 + 87 = 17 * (A + 3)
16A + 87 = 17A + 51
A = 87 - 51
A = 36

So, the batsman's average after the 16th inning is 36. After the 17th inning, his total runs become 36 * 16 + 87 = 663, and the total number of innings is 17. Therefore, his average after 17 innings is 663 / 17 ≈ 39.

**Problem X: B’s salary is 15% more than A’s salary. By what percent is A’s salary less than B’s salary?**

Solution:
Let's assume A's salary is 'x' units.

Given that B's salary is 15% more than A's salary:
B's salary = A's salary + 0.15 * A's salary = 1.15 * A's salary

The difference in their salaries:
Difference = B's salary - A's salary = 1.15 * A's salary - x

To find the percentage by which A's salary is less than B's salary:
Percentage = (Difference / B's salary) * 100

Substitute the value of Difference and B's salary:
Percentage = ((1.15 * A's salary - x) / (1.15 * A's salary)) * 100

This percentage represents how much A's salary is less than B's salary.
